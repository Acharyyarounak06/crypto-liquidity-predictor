# Final Report

## Summary
This project explores the prediction of cryptocurrency liquidity using historical trading data. The key idea is to derive meaningful signals from the price and volume trends and train a machine learning model to predict future liquidity-related values.

## Key Highlights
- Used a real-world dataset (`coin_gecko_2022-03-16.csv`)
- Conducted EDA to find trends and correlations
- Engineered features like moving averages and volatility
- Trained a Random Forest model with decent performance
- Planned a local deployment using Streamlit for live predictions

## Model Performance
- RMSE: ~X.XX
- MAE: ~X.XX
- RÂ² Score: ~0.XX

## Future Improvements
- Use LSTM or ARIMA models for better temporal forecasting
- Incorporate social media sentiment or news data
- Full web-based deployment
